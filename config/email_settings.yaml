  Hi {creator_name},

  I'm {sender_name} from UTOPAI Studios – an AI-powered 3D animation studio.

  Loved your work on {project_title} – particularly the {technical_detail}. We're building a platform that lets creators like you design and animate virtual characters in real-time using AI, and we think your style would be perfect for it.

  Would love to give you an early look and get your thoughts. Here's a quick link to book a call if you'd like to connect:
